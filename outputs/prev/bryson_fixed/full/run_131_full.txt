If no true positive vulnerabilities are found respond NONE in your analysis description. You have access to a peer RAG agent. If you would like more basic information on a vulnerability, then at the end of your response, respond with 'QNA:', then your list of questions. Your questions should be at the very end of your message. Keep your questions as simple as possible, as you are querying the Common Weakness Enumeration database. An example request would be to provide a description or example of a specific type of vulnerability. If you have no questions, end your response with 'END' instead. Please engage in at least one round of QNA.  When you have exhaustively reasoned through all existing vulnerabilities, and excluded all false postives, output your final revised analysis prepended by: 'FINAL ANALYSIS:'. Include a line stating 'VERDICT:', then 'VULNERABLE' or 'SAFE' based upon your results.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='Prompter_node')]), ('sender', 'Prompter_node'), ('target', 'Analyzer'), ('rag_calls', 5)], 'interrupts': []}}

Below is a detailed evaluation of the code, referencing the previous tool summaries and conducting an independent analysis.\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Functions Involved**: The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows. For instance:\n     - In `processUserData`, `strcpy(command, baseCommand);` and `strcat(command, userInput);` do not check if `userInput` exceeds the size of `command`, which can lead to overflow if the input is too long.\n     - In `logUserData`, `sprintf(logMessage, "User %s logged in.", userName);` does not limit the length of `userName`, which can also lead to buffer overflow.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use safer alternatives like `snprintf` for `sprintf`, and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated result.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `system(command);` in `processUserData` is particularly dangerous as it executes a command string that can be influenced by user input. If an attacker can control `userInput`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `system()` for executing commands. Instead, consider using safer library functions that provide the same functionality without the risks associated with command execution.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The `fopen("user_log.txt", "a");` in `logUserData` does not check if the file can be opened successfully, which can lead to issues if the file path is manipulated or if the file is redirected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always check the return value of `fopen` and handle errors appropriately. Additionally, consider using secure file handling practices to prevent race conditions or symlink attacks.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` is incorrect as it uses a format specifier that can lead to undefined behavior if `logMessage` is not properly formatted or controlled.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Unchecked Input**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure that it is null-terminated or properly sanitized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\n### QNA:\n1. What are the best practices for preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities in C?\n2. Can you provide examples of safer alternatives to `system()` for executing commands in C?\n3. What are the common methods to securely handle file operations in C?\n4. How can format string vulnerabilities be effectively mitigated in C programming? \n\nEND', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 682, 'prompt_tokens': 30406, 'total_tokens': 31088, 'completion_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0705bf87c0', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='Analyzer', id='run-5e9c0498-e26e-48bc-805f-3e800e1ae8aa-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 30406, 'output_tokens': 682, 'total_tokens': 31088, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]), ('sender', 'Analyzer'), ('target', 'Prompter_node'), ('rag_calls', 5)], 'interrupts': []}}

Below is a detailed evaluation of the code, referencing the previous tool summaries and conducting an independent analysis.\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Functions Involved**: The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows. For instance:\n     - In `processUserData`, `strcpy(command, baseCommand);` and `strcat(command, userInput);` do not check if `userInput` exceeds the size of `command`, which can lead to overflow if the input is too long.\n     - In `logUserData`, `sprintf(logMessage, "User %s logged in.", userName);` does not limit the length of `userName`, which can also lead to buffer overflow.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use safer alternatives like `snprintf` for `sprintf`, and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated result.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `system(command);` in `processUserData` is particularly dangerous as it executes a command string that can be influenced by user input. If an attacker can control `userInput`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `system()` for executing commands. Instead, consider using safer library functions that provide the same functionality without the risks associated with command execution.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The `fopen("user_log.txt", "a");` in `logUserData` does not check if the file can be opened successfully, which can lead to issues if the file path is manipulated or if the file is redirected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always check the return value of `fopen` and handle errors appropriately. Additionally, consider using secure file handling practices to prevent race conditions or symlink attacks.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` is incorrect as it uses a format specifier that can lead to undefined behavior if `logMessage` is not properly formatted or controlled.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Unchecked Input**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure that it is null-terminated or properly sanitized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\n### QNA:\n1. What are the best practices for preventing buffer overflow vulnerabilities in C?\n2. Can you provide examples of safer alternatives to `system()` for executing commands in C?\n3.

Below is a detailed evaluation of the code, referencing the previous tool summaries and conducting an independent analysis.\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Functions Involved**: The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows. For instance:\n     - In `processUserData`, `strcpy(command, baseCommand);` and `strcat(command, userInput);` do not check if `userInput` exceeds the size of `command`, which can lead to overflow if the input is too long.\n     - In `logUserData`, `sprintf(logMessage, "User %s logged in.", userName);` does not limit the length of `userName`, which can also lead to buffer overflow.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use safer alternatives like `snprintf` for `sprintf`, and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated result.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `system(command);` in `processUserData` is particularly dangerous as it executes a command string that can be influenced by user input. If an attacker can control `userInput`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `system()` for executing commands. Instead, consider using safer library functions that provide the same functionality without the risks associated with command execution.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The `fopen("user_log.txt", "a");` in `logUserData` does not check if the file can be opened successfully, which can lead to issues if the file path is manipulated or if the file is redirected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always check the return value of `fopen` and handle errors appropriately. Additionally, consider using secure file handling practices to prevent race conditions or symlink attacks.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` is incorrect as it uses a format specifier that can lead to undefined behavior if `logMessage` is not properly formatted or controlled.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Unchecked Input**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure that it is null-terminated or properly sanitized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\n### QNA:\n1.

Below is a detailed evaluation of the code, referencing the previous tool summaries and conducting an independent analysis.\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Functions Involved**: The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows. For instance:\n     - In `processUserData`, `strcpy(command, baseCommand);` and `strcat(command, userInput);` do not check if `userInput` exceeds the size of `command`, which can lead to overflow if the input is too long.\n     - In `logUserData`, `sprintf(logMessage, "User %s logged in.", userName);` does not limit the length of `userName`, which can also lead to buffer overflow.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use safer alternatives like `snprintf` for `sprintf`, and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated result.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `system(command);` in `processUserData` is particularly dangerous as it executes a command string that can be influenced by user input. If an attacker can control `userInput`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `system()` for executing commands. Instead, consider using safer library functions that provide the same functionality without the risks associated with command execution.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The `fopen("user_log.txt", "a");` in `logUserData` does not check if the file can be opened successfully, which can lead to issues if the file path is manipulated or if the file is redirected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always check the return value of `fopen` and handle errors appropriately. Additionally, consider using secure file handling practices to prevent race conditions or symlink attacks.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` is incorrect as it uses a format specifier that can lead to undefined behavior if `logMessage` is not properly formatted or controlled.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Unchecked Input**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure that it is null-terminated or properly sanitized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\n### QNA:\n1.

Below is a detailed evaluation of the code, referencing the previous tool summaries and conducting an independent analysis.\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Functions Involved**: The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows. For instance:\n     - In `processUserData`, `strcpy(command, baseCommand);` and `strcat(command, userInput);` do not check if `userInput` exceeds the size of `command`, which can lead to overflow if the input is too long.\n     - In `logUserData`, `sprintf(logMessage, "User %s logged in.", userName);` does not limit the length of `userName`, which can also lead to buffer overflow.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use safer alternatives like `snprintf` for `sprintf`, and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated result.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `system(command);` in `processUserData` is particularly dangerous as it executes a command string that can be influenced by user input. If an attacker can control `userInput`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `system()` for executing commands. Instead, consider using safer library functions that provide the same functionality without the risks associated with command execution.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The `fopen("user_log.txt", "a");` in `logUserData` does not check if the file can be opened successfully, which can lead to issues if the file path is manipulated or if the file is redirected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always check the return value of `fopen` and handle errors appropriately. Additionally, consider using secure file handling practices to prevent race conditions or symlink attacks.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` is incorrect as it uses a format specifier that can lead to undefined behavior if `logMessage` is not properly formatted or controlled.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Unchecked Input**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure that it is null-terminated or properly sanitized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\n### QNA:\n1.

Here’s a refined analysis based on the best practices and safer alternatives discussed:\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking is a critical issue. The best practices suggest using vetted libraries and safe string handling functions. The code should be updated to use `snprintf` for `sprintf` and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffers are adequately sized and checked.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - The use of `system(command);` poses a severe risk as it allows for command injection if user input is not sanitized. The recommended alternatives, such as the `exec` family of functions or `popen()`, should be employed to mitigate this risk. These alternatives provide better control over command execution and reduce the potential for exploitation.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The `fopen` function lacks error handling, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the file path is manipulated. Implementing proper error checks after file operations is essential. Additionally, using libraries that provide safer file handling routines can help prevent issues related to file access and manipulation.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The incorrect use of format specifiers in `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` can lead to undefined behavior. The code should be corrected to use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Unchecked Input**:\n   - The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure it is null-terminated or sanitized. Implementing input validation and sanitization is crucial to prevent undefined behavior and potential exploitation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe vulnerabilities identified in the original code sample are significant and should be addressed to ensure the security and robustness of the application. The recommendations provided in the analysis should be implemented to mitigate these risks effectively.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\nEND', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 448, 'prompt_tokens': 31617, 'total_tokens': 32065, 'completion_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 30336}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0705bf87c0', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='Analyzer', id='run-ccc9b066-d30f-4ae6-bf79-5b104df56bdb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 31617, 'output_tokens': 448, 'total_tokens': 32065, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 30336}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]), ('sender', 'Analyzer'), ('target', 'Prompter_node'), ('rag_calls', 4)], 'interrupts': []}}

Below is a detailed evaluation of the code, referencing the previous tool summaries and conducting an independent analysis.\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Functions Involved**: The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows. For instance:\n     - In `processUserData`, `strcpy(command, baseCommand);` and `strcat(command, userInput);` do not check if `userInput` exceeds the size of `command`, which can lead to overflow if the input is too long.\n     - In `logUserData`, `sprintf(logMessage, "User %s logged in.", userName);` does not limit the length of `userName`, which can also lead to buffer overflow.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use safer alternatives like `snprintf` for `sprintf`, and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated result.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `system(command);` in `processUserData` is particularly dangerous as it executes a command string that can be influenced by user input. If an attacker can control `userInput`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `system()` for executing commands. Instead, consider using safer library functions that provide the same functionality without the risks associated with command execution.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The `fopen("user_log.txt", "a");` in `logUserData` does not check if the file can be opened successfully, which can lead to issues if the file path is manipulated or if the file is redirected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always check the return value of `fopen` and handle errors appropriately. Additionally, consider using secure file handling practices to prevent race conditions or symlink attacks.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` is incorrect as it uses a format specifier that can lead to undefined behavior if `logMessage` is not properly formatted or controlled.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Unchecked Input**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure that it is null-terminated or properly sanitized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\n### QNA:\n1.

Here’s a refined analysis based on the best practices and safer alternatives discussed:\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking is a critical issue. The best practices suggest using vetted libraries and safe string handling functions. The code should be updated to use `snprintf` for `sprintf` and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffers are adequately sized and checked.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - The use of `system(command);` poses a severe risk as it allows for command injection if user input is not sanitized. The recommended alternatives, such as the `exec` family of functions or `popen()`, should be employed to mitigate this risk. These alternatives provide better control over command execution and reduce the potential for exploitation.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The `fopen` function lacks error handling, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the file path is manipulated. Implementing proper error checks after file operations is essential. Additionally, using libraries that provide safer file handling routines can help prevent issues related to file access and manipulation.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The incorrect use of format specifiers in `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` can lead to undefined behavior. The code should be corrected to use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Unchecked Input**:\n   - The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure it is null-terminated or sanitized. Implementing input validation and sanitization is crucial to prevent undefined behavior and potential exploitation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe vulnerabilities identified in the original code sample are significant and should be addressed to ensure the security and robustness of the application.

Below is a detailed evaluation of the code, referencing the previous tool summaries and conducting an independent analysis.\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Functions Involved**: The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflows. For instance:\n     - In `processUserData`, `strcpy(command, baseCommand);` and `strcat(command, userInput);` do not check if `userInput` exceeds the size of `command`, which can lead to overflow if the input is too long.\n     - In `logUserData`, `sprintf(logMessage, "User %s logged in.", userName);` does not limit the length of `userName`, which can also lead to buffer overflow.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use safer alternatives like `snprintf` for `sprintf`, and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated result.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `system(command);` in `processUserData` is particularly dangerous as it executes a command string that can be influenced by user input. If an attacker can control `userInput`, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n   - **Recommendation**: Avoid using `system()` for executing commands. Instead, consider using safer library functions that provide the same functionality without the risks associated with command execution.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The `fopen("user_log.txt", "a");` in `logUserData` does not check if the file can be opened successfully, which can lead to issues if the file path is manipulated or if the file is redirected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always check the return value of `fopen` and handle errors appropriately. Additionally, consider using secure file handling practices to prevent race conditions or symlink attacks.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The use of `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` is incorrect as it uses a format specifier that can lead to undefined behavior if `logMessage` is not properly formatted or controlled.\n   - **Recommendation**: Use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential for Unchecked Input**:\n   - **Function Involved**: The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure that it is null-terminated or properly sanitized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.\n   - **Recommendation**: Always validate and sanitize user input before processing it.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\n### QNA:\n1.

Here’s a refined analysis based on the best practices and safer alternatives discussed:\n\n1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The use of `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking is a critical issue. The best practices suggest using vetted libraries and safe string handling functions. The code should be updated to use `snprintf` for `sprintf` and `strncat` for `strcat`, ensuring that the destination buffers are adequately sized and checked.\n\n2. **Dynamic Execution Risks**:\n   - The use of `system(command);` poses a severe risk as it allows for command injection if user input is not sanitized. The recommended alternatives, such as the `exec` family of functions or `popen()`, should be employed to mitigate this risk. These alternatives provide better control over command execution and reduce the potential for exploitation.\n\n3. **File Handling Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The `fopen` function lacks error handling, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the file path is manipulated. Implementing proper error checks after file operations is essential. Additionally, using libraries that provide safer file handling routines can help prevent issues related to file access and manipulation.\n\n4. **Format String Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The incorrect use of format specifiers in `fprintf(logFile, "%%s", logMessage);` can lead to undefined behavior. The code should be corrected to use a proper format string, such as `fprintf(logFile, "%s", logMessage);`, to avoid format string vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Unchecked Input**:\n   - The function `processUserData` checks the length of `userInput` but does not ensure it is null-terminated or sanitized. Implementing input validation and sanitization is crucial to prevent undefined behavior and potential exploitation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe vulnerabilities identified in the original code sample are significant and should be addressed to ensure the security and robustness of the application. The recommendations provided in the analysis should be implemented to mitigate these risks effectively.\n\n### VERDICT: VULNERABLE\n\nEND', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 448, 'prompt_tokens': 31617, 'total_tokens': 32065, 'completion_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 30336}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0705bf87c0', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='Analyzer', id='run-ccc9b066-d30f-4ae6-bf79-5b104df56bdb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 31617, 'output_tokens': 448, 'total_tokens': 32065, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 30336}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), HumanMessage(content='Prepend your response with \'FINAL ANSWER:\'.
