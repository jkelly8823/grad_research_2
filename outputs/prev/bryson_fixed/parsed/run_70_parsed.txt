Please summarize all of the static analysis results from each of the previous tool runs. Indicate which tools you are summarizing in your response. Summarize the tool responses one by one to ensure correct labelling.

Summarizer
--------------------------------------------------
### Summary of Static Analysis Results

#### Tool: cppcheck
- **Warnings:**
  1. **Parameter 'userCount' can be declared as pointer to const**: This suggests that the function could be improved by making the parameter read-only.
  2. **The function 'getActiveUserCount' is never used**: Indicates that the function is defined but not called anywhere in the code.

#### Tool: flawfinder
- **Warnings:**
  1. **Buffer Overflows**: Multiple instances where functions like `strncpy`, `strcpy`, and `sprintf` do not check for buffer overflows, which can lead to vulnerabilities (CWE-120).
  2. **Use of `gets`**: The use of `gets` is flagged for not checking buffer overflows.
  3. **Improperly restricted statically-sized arrays**: Several warnings about potential overflows due to statically-sized arrays not being properly checked.
  4. **Potential issues with `fopen`**: Warnings about the security risks associated with file opening, such as symlink attacks and race conditions (CWE-362).

#### Tool: semgrep
- **Warnings:**
  - The output from this tool was empty, indicating no specific issues were found in the code.

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates potential security vulnerabilities primarily related to buffer overflows and improper handling of input/output functions. The cppcheck tool highlighted style improvements and unused functions, while flawfinder provided detailed warnings about specific functions that could lead to security issues. The semgrep tool did not report any findings.

Please utilize the output of the summary to inform your analysis of the original code sample. Evaluate it for any vulnerabilities you can find while avoiding false positives. Intensively review all detections, reasoning through to ensure they are accurate. Utilize the tool summaries to assist your analysis, but do not solely rely upon them. Perform an additional step-by-step intense evaluation of code using your capabilities. If no true positive vulnerabilities are found respond NONE in your analysis description. You have access to a peer RAG agent. If you would like more basic information on a vulnerability, then at the end of your response, respond with 'QNA:', then your list of questions. Your questions should be at the very end of your message. Keep your questions as simple as possible, as you are querying the Common Weakness Enumeration database. An example request would be to provide a description or example of a specific type of vulnerability. If you have no questions, end your response with 'END' instead. Please engage in at least one round of QNA.  When you have exhaustively reasoned through all existing vulnerabilities, and excluded all false postives, output your final revised analysis prepended by: 'FINAL ANALYSIS:'. Include a line stating 'VERDICT:', then 'VULNERABLE' or 'SAFE' based upon your results.

### Analysis of the Original Code Sample

The provided code sample is as follows:

```c
void getActiveUserCount(int* userCount) {
    int* loginAttempts = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (loginAttempts == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    *loginAttempts = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < *userCount; i++) {
        if (isActive) {
            (*loginAttempts)++;
        }
    }
    char* sessionToken = (char*)malloc(256);
    if (sessionToken == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    strncpy(sessionToken, "token_value", 256);
}
```

#### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Memory Allocation and Null Check**:
   - The code allocates memory for `loginAttempts` and checks if the allocation was successful. If `malloc` returns `NULL`, the function exits early. This is a good practice to prevent dereferencing a null pointer.

2. **Potential Buffer Overflow**:
   - The `strncpy` function is used to copy a string into `sessionToken`. However, `strncpy` does not guarantee null termination if the source string is longer than the specified length. In this case, the source string "token_value" is shorter than 256 characters, so it will not cause an overflow, but it may not null-terminate the destination string. This can lead to undefined behavior if the string is used later without proper null termination.

3. **Unused Variable**:
   - The variable `loginAttempts` is allocated and incremented, but its value is never used after the loop. This could indicate a logical flaw in the code, but it does not directly lead to a vulnerability.

4. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates based on the value pointed to by `userCount`. If `userCount` is not properly initialized or if it points to an invalid memory location, this could lead to undefined behavior. The code does not validate the value of `*userCount`, which could lead to out-of-bounds access if `*userCount` is negative or excessively large.

5. **Potential Use of Uninitialized Variable**:
   - The variable `isActive` is referenced in the loop but is not defined within the function. If `isActive` is not properly initialized before this function is called, it could lead to undefined behavior.

6. **Memory Leak**:
   - The allocated memory for `loginAttempts` and `sessionToken` is never freed, leading to a memory leak. This is not a direct vulnerability but can lead to resource exhaustion in long-running applications.

### Summary of Findings
- **Buffer Overflow Risk**: The use of `strncpy` without ensuring null termination can lead to potential buffer overflow issues.
- **Out-of-Bounds Access**: The loop iterating based on `*userCount` without validation can lead to out-of-bounds access.
- **Undefined Behavior**: The use of the uninitialized variable `isActive` can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Memory Leak**: The allocated memory is not freed, leading to potential resource exhaustion.

### FINAL ANALYSIS:
The code contains several vulnerabilities, primarily related to memory management and potential undefined behavior due to uninitialized variables. The most critical issues are the risk of buffer overflow and out-of-bounds access.

**VERDICT:** VULNERABLE

### Revised Analysis of the Original Code Sample

The provided code sample is as follows:

```c
void getActiveUserCount(int* userCount) {
    int* loginAttempts = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (loginAttempts == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    *loginAttempts = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < *userCount; i++) {

    if (sessionToken == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    strncpy(sessionToken, "token_value", 256);
}
```

#### Step-by-Step Evaluation

1. **Memory Allocation and Null Check**:
   - The code correctly checks if `malloc` returns `NULL` for both `loginAttempts` and `sessionToken`, which is a good practice to prevent dereferencing null pointers.

2. **Potential Buffer Overflow**:
   - The use of `strncpy` to copy "token_value" into `sessionToken` does not guarantee null termination if the source string is longer than the specified length. Although in this case, the source string is shorter than 256 characters, it is still a risk because if the source were to change in the future, it could lead to undefined behavior.

3. **Unused Variable**:
   - The variable `loginAttempts` is allocated and incremented, but its value is never used after the loop. This indicates a logical flaw in the code but does not directly lead to a vulnerability.

4. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates based on the value pointed to by `userCount`. If `userCount` is not properly initialized or points to an invalid memory location, this could lead to undefined behavior. The code does not validate the value of `*userCount`, which could lead to out-of-bounds access if `*userCount` is negative or excessively large.
