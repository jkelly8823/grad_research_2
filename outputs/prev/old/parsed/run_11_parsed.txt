Summarizer
--------------------------------------------------
The static analysis results from the following tools have been summarized:

1. **Flawfinder**:
   - **Line 6**: The use of `strcpy` does not check for buffer overflows when copying to the destination, which is a security risk (CWE-120). Alternatives like `snprintf`, `strcpy_s`, or `strlcpy` are recommended.
   - **Line 2**: The statically-sized array `buffer` can lead to potential overflows or issues (CWE-119/CWE-120). It is advised to perform bounds checking or use functions that limit length.
   - **Line 9**: The use of `sprintf` does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). It is suggested to use `sprintf_s`, `snprintf`, or `vsnprintf`.

2. **Cppcheck**:
   - **Line 9**: There is an error indicating that the buffer is accessed out of bounds.
   - **Lines 2-4**: The scopes of the variables `buffer`, `discountedPrice`, and `discountAmount` can be reduced for better code clarity.
   - **Line 1**: The parameter `userInput` can be declared as a pointer to const.
   - **Line 1**: The function `calculateDiscountedPrice` is never used, indicating it may be unnecessary.

3. **Semgrep**:
   - **Line 6**: The use of `strcpy` is flagged as a banned function due to lack of bounds checking. Alternatives are suggested.
   - **Line 9**: The use of `sprintf` is also flagged as a banned function due to limited error detection, with recommendations for safer alternatives.

Overall, the analysis highlights significant security risks related to buffer overflows and suggests using safer functions for string manipulation. Additionally, there are style and scope issues that could improve code quality.

Analyzer
--------------------------------------------------
FINAL ANALYSIS: 

The original code sample contains several vulnerabilities primarily related to buffer overflows and improper handling of user input. Here are the identified vulnerabilities:

1. **Buffer Overflow Risk with `strcpy`**:
   - The use of `strcpy(buffer, userInput);` does not check the length of `userInput` before copying it into the `buffer`, which is statically sized to 10 characters. If `userInput` exceeds this length, it will lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory. This is a clear violation of CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input).

2. **Buffer Overflow Risk with `sprintf`**:
   - The line `sprintf(buffer, "Discounted Price: %d", discountedPrice);` also poses a risk of buffer overflow. The `sprintf` function does not limit the number of characters written to `buffer`, which can lead to overflow if the formatted string exceeds the buffer size. This is another instance of CWE-120.

3. **Static Array Size**:
   - The static size of the `buffer` array (10 characters) is insufficient for safely handling the expected output from the `sprintf` function, especially considering the potential size of the formatted string. This can lead to buffer overflow issues as mentioned above (CWE-119).

4. **Unused Function**:
   - The function `calculateDiscountedPrice` is never used, which may indicate dead code. While this is not a direct vulnerability, it can lead to maintenance issues and confusion in the codebase.

5. **Improper Parameter Handling**:
   - The parameter `userInput` is passed as a mutable pointer (`char *`). It would be safer to declare it as a pointer to const (`const char *`) to prevent accidental modification of the input data.

In conclusion, the code sample has multiple vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows due to unsafe string handling functions and insufficient buffer sizes. These issues should be addressed to enhance the security and reliability of the code.

1. The best practice for safely copying strings in C is to use safer versions of string-handling functions, such as those provided by the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) or Strsafe.h from Microsoft, which help prevent buffer overflows. 

2. To determine the maximum length of a formatted string before using `sprintf`, you can use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions, which provide range checking.

3. Using a static array for user input in C can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input exceeds the array's size, as it does not dynamically adjust to varying input lengths.
