Please determine the necessary file type, then run all relevant tools to analyze the following code:
```
void calculateDiscountedPrice(char *userInput, int itemPrice, float discountRate) {
    char buffer[10];
    int discountedPrice;
    float discountAmount;
    if (isLoggedIn) {
        strcpy(buffer, userInput);
        discountAmount = (itemPrice * discountRate) / 100;
        discountedPrice = itemPrice - (int)discountAmount;
        sprintf(buffer, "Discounted Price: %d", discountedPrice);
        printf("%s\n", buffer);
    } else {
        printf("User is not logged in.\n");
    }

ANALYZER OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------
Let me revise my vulnerability analysis without the authentication questions, focusing on what we can definitively confirm:

Confirmed Vulnerabilities:

1. Buffer Overflow via strcpy (CWE-120)
- Severity: High
- The 10-byte buffer can be overflowed by any userInput longer than 9 bytes
- No bounds checking is performed
- Can lead to memory corruption and potential code execution
- Exploitable through user-controlled input parameter

2. Buffer Overflow via sprintf (CWE-120)
- Severity: High
- The format string "Discounted Price: %d" is 19 characters minimum
- Will always overflow the 10-byte buffer
- Not dependent on user input but still a critical flaw
- Will cause buffer overflow on every execution where isLoggedIn is true

I'm removing the authentication concern from my previous analysis as we cannot make definitive claims about the isLoggedIn variable without more context about its implementation and scope.

These two buffer overflow vulnerabilities are confirmed true positives with clear paths to exploitation. The code requires significant rework using proper bounds-checking functions (like strncpy, snprintf) and appropriate buffer sizes to be secure.--------------------------------------------------
FINAL SUMMARY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------
FINAL ANSWER: VULNERABLE

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 10

The analysis has confirmed two high severity buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CWE-120) in the provided code sample:

1. Buffer overflow via strcpy due to lack of bounds checking when copying user-controlled input into a fixed 10-byte buffer. This can lead to memory corruption and potential code execution.

2. Buffer overflow via sprintf as the format string alone exceeds the 10-byte buffer size, guaranteeing an overflow on every execution where isLoggedIn is true. 

These vulnerabilities are definite true positives with clear exploitation paths. The code requires secure re-implementation using bounds-checked functions like strncpy and snprintf, along with properly sized buffers to remediate these flaws.

The authentication concern regarding isLoggedIn was removed due to lack of context about its implementation and scope.
